A production-ready hybrid real-estate product search agent that: Automatically decides between data-source search (structured filters / transactional DB lookups) and semantic search (vector embeddings + similarity) based on the user's query.  Integrates Redis for memory/cache, and tuned for Uvicorn (ASGI) for async performance &amp; scalability.
